Financial troubles, bankruptcies, or career setbacks are additional markers. Criticism and backlash from the public or within the industry further contribute to a negative sentiment.",
        "neutral": "Neutral sentiment in entertainment news articles is marked by content that is factual, informative, and devoid of strong emotional language. This includes simple announcements of upcoming projects, casting news, or release dates without any evaluative commentary. Obituaries and tributes, while inherently solemn, are generally neutral as they aim to inform rather than elicit strong negative or positive reactions. Interviews and quotes from celebrities that focus on informative aspects or provide insights without delving into personal opinions or controversies are neutral. Box office statistics, viewership numbers, and sales figures presented in an objective manner also fall under neutral sentiment. Additionally, articles summarizing events such as award shows, festivals, or industry conferences with a focus on what happened rather than how it was received are typically neutral.",

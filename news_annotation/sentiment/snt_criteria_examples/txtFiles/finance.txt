Finance:

Positive:
Positive sentiment in finance news articles typically includes content that indicates growth, profit, success, or improvement. This can be identified through keywords and phrases that highlight positive financial performance, such as "record profits," "revenue growth," "market expansion," "successful acquisition," "stock surge," "strong earnings report," and "upward trends." Articles discussing favorable economic conditions, positive forecasts, new product launches, strategic partnerships, or regulatory approvals also fall into this category. Additionally, positive sentiment can be inferred from expert opinions or analyst predictions that project future gains and stability for a company or the market overall.

Negative:
Negative sentiment in finance news articles is characterized by content that suggests loss, decline, failure, or deterioration. This includes keywords and phrases such as "losses," "decline in revenue," "market downturn," "earnings miss," "stock plummet," "layoffs," "bankruptcy," and "economic slowdown." Articles discussing adverse economic conditions, negative forecasts, product recalls, failed mergers or acquisitions, legal issues, or regulatory setbacks are also indicative of negative sentiment. Expert opinions or analyst predictions that project future losses, instability, or challenges for a company or the market are additional indicators of negative sentiment.

Neutral:
Neutral sentiment in finance news articles is typically identified by content that is factual and informative without an overtly positive or negative tone. This includes reporting on financial activities, market movements, economic indicators, and company announcements without subjective interpretation. Keywords and phrases such as "quarterly report," "financial statement," "stock performance," "market analysis," "economic data," "trading volume," and "industry trends" often indicate a neutral sentiment. Articles that present balanced views, mixed outcomes, or data-driven insights without strong opinions, as well as those that provide context or background information, are also considered neutral.

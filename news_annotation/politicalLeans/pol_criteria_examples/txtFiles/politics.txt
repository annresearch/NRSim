Politics:

Left:
Articles with a left political lean often emphasize social justice, equality, and progressive reforms. They tend to support policies that promote government intervention in the economy, advocate for higher taxes on the wealthy, and push for expanded social welfare programs. Content typically focuses on environmental protection, labor rights, racial and gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and healthcare reform. These articles may criticize corporate power, military spending, and conservative social policies. They often highlight stories about marginalized communities and call for systemic changes to address social inequalities.

Center:
Center-leaning articles strive for a balanced perspective, often presenting multiple sides of an issue without overtly endorsing any particular viewpoint. They emphasize pragmatism, moderation, and compromise. Content typically supports incremental reforms rather than radical changes and may advocate for both market-based and government solutions depending on the issue. These articles often cover bipartisan initiatives, emphasize the importance of democratic institutions, and highlight the need for national unity. They are likely to provide equal coverage of criticisms and praises for both left and right policies and politicians.

Right:
Articles with a right political lean often prioritize individual liberties, free-market principles, and traditional values. They tend to support lower taxes, reduced government regulation, and a strong national defense. Content typically focuses on economic growth, personal responsibility, and law and order. These articles may criticize government overreach, advocate for stricter immigration policies, and support conservative social policies such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. They often highlight stories about national security, economic achievements, and the benefits of a free-market economy.

Left:
Articles with a left-leaning perspective on science and technology often emphasize the role of government regulation, environmental protection, and social justice. They may advocate for increased public funding for scientific research, particularly in areas like renewable energy, climate change, and healthcare technologies. These articles are likely to highlight the negative impacts of technological advancements on marginalized communities and may call for more stringent ethical standards in tech development. They often support policies that promote net neutrality, data privacy, and equitable access to technology. Criticism of large tech corporations for monopolistic practices and their role in socioeconomic inequality is common. The tone often reflects a cautious optimism about technology's potential to solve societal problems if guided by progressive principles.

Center:

They often express skepticism about climate change science and may oppose extensive environmental regulations, instead promoting technological solutions that align with market principles. The content might also focus on national security concerns related to technology, such as cybersecurity and the geopolitical implications of technological advancements. The tone often reflects a strong belief in the market's ability to address technological and scientific challenges independently.

        "left": "Articles with a left-leaning political perspective on weather news often emphasize the impact of climate change and advocate for environmental justice. These articles typically highlight how extreme weather events are exacerbated by human activities, particularly the actions of large corporations and industrial sectors. They may discuss the disproportionate effects of weather phenomena on marginalized and vulnerable communities, calling for systemic changes and government intervention to address these issues. The language used is often urgent and may call for immediate and radical policy changes to mitigate future risks. The articles might also support renewable energy initiatives, criticize fossil fuel industries, and promote international cooperation on climate action.",
        "center": "Center-leaning weather news articles strive to present a balanced view of weather events, often focusing on factual reporting without strong ideological angles. These articles provide comprehensive coverage of weather phenomena, including scientific explanations, impacts on various communities, and government responses. They aim to present multiple perspectives, including expert opinions from climatologists, meteorologists, and policymakers. While they may acknowledge the role of climate change, they tend to avoid attributing specific weather events directly to it without substantial evidence. The tone is generally neutral and informative, emphasizing preparedness, response strategies, and practical advice for the general public. These articles tend to avoid advocating for specific political actions, instead focusing on data and expert analysis.",
        "right": "Right-leaning weather news articles often downplay the link between climate change and specific weather events, instead attributing them to natural variability. These articles may emphasize the resilience and adaptability of communities and criticize alarmist views on climate change. They often highlight the economic costs of proposed environmental regulations and promote market-based solutions or technological innovations as alternatives to government intervention. The language used may be skeptical of climate science consensus, and there might be a focus on individual responsibility and local-level responses rather than federal or international mandates. These articles might also underscore the importance of maintaining energy independence and the economic benefits of traditional energy sources like oil and gas.",

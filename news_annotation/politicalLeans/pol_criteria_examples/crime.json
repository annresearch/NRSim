        "left": "Crime news articles with a left-leaning political bias often focus on systemic issues and societal factors contributing to criminal behavior. These articles may emphasize the role of socioeconomic disparities, lack of access to education and healthcare, and systemic racism or discrimination. They tend to advocate for criminal justice reform, highlighting the need for rehabilitation over punishment and questioning the effectiveness and fairness of law enforcement practices.

These articles typically present facts and data without much editorializing, allowing readers to form their own opinions. They might include multiple perspectives, such as statements from law enforcement, victims, community leaders, and criminal justice experts. Centrist articles avoid sensationalism and focus on the specifics of the case, legal proceedings, and the broader impact on the community. They may discuss both the need for law enforcement and criminal justice reform, but they do so in a balanced way, acknowledging the complexities and nuances of these issues.",

These articles may focus on individual responsibility and the need for personal accountability, often highlighting the threat that crime poses to public safety and social stability. Right-leaning articles might support policies such as increased police funding, mandatory minimum sentences, and tougher immigration controls to prevent crime. They may also emphasize the experiences and rights of victims, advocating for swift and severe punishment for offenders. The language used is often more punitive, framing criminals as threats to society who need to be deterred through strong legal measures.",
